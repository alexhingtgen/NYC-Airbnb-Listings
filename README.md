2. Rename the directory to reflect the new project name
3. Delete .git folder
4. Continue working with the project and making desired edits
5. Make commits for the project and track changes

## Usage
One goes about using my portfolio website by browsing the various pages on the website to learn more information about my life, achievements, goals, and hobbies. Additionally, users could clone this GitHub project and make edits to the template to discuss their own personal information.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_. Much of the coding from this project could be reusable and helpful in analyzing similar data in a more current period. However, the analysis on the data in this Data Wrangling final project is completed.

## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Website design could flow more smoothly and offer a more simplified path through the pages
