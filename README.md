 # NYC Airbnb Listings and Household Economics
In this group project, I examined data on Airbnb rental locations in New York City in 2020 and the impact that housing as well as economic measures in NYC neighborhoods have on the cost and consumer experience of overnight Airbnb stays.

## General Information
The analysis on New York City Airbnb listing information as well as household economics was done for a final project in my Data Wrangling course at the University of Iowa. A few fellow students in the course and I tested our R coding skills by running different tests on the data to draw insights on the NYC Airbnb industry and determinents of listing price and customer experience. Additionally, a main portion of the project was spent creating a web crawling script that provided household economic data regarding the five boroughs in New York City. The project also focused on data visualization and creating graphics that exhibit the key findings.

## Technologies Used
- R programming language
- Kaggle csv dataset & U.S. Census data

## Features
The ready features for my NYC Airbnb Listings and Household Economics project include:
- In-depth written analysis of the key findings in the project found in the PDF file
- Graphs and tables visualizing the integrated datasets
- Web crawling script that browsed and retrieved NYC household economics information

## Setup
All of the necessary files and coding needed to replicate this project can be found in the project GitHub repository. For users looking to take this project and test the coding script, the following steps would apply:
1. Clone this repository to local computer using the project link
2. Rename the directory to reflect the new project name
3. Run the R coding script utilizing the dataset provided and web crawling
4. Continue running other tests with the project and making desired edits

## Usage
One goes about using my Data Wrangling final project by examining the files in the repository and learning from the key insights. Moreover, users could clone the repository and run the R coding scripts to test the project.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_. Much of the coding from this project could be reusable and helpful in analyzing similar data in a more current period. However, the analysis on the data in this Data Wrangling final project is completed.

## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- NYC data examined could be more current and higher quality by containing less N/A values
- Conclusions could examine more Airbnb markets and not only NYC
- Other popular vacation destinations could be studied to better understand Airbnb

## Acknowledgements
The Data Wrangling final project was assigned by the University of Iowa Associate Professor of Practice named Michael Colbert and guidance was provided by the teacher throughout the project. Additionally, insight on web crawling was provided by our teaching assistant.
